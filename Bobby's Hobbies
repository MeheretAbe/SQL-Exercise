--The query retrieve all persons' names along with their respective hobbies. 
The result will include multiple rows, each representing a person's name and their corresponding hobby.

--1. created a database of people and hobbies, and each row in hobbies is related to a row in persons via the person_id column. 
In this first step, insert one more row in persons and then one more row in hobbies that is related to the newly inserted person

CREATE TABLE persons (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT,
    age INTEGER);
    
INSERT INTO persons (name, age) VALUES ("Bobby McBobbyFace", 12);
INSERT INTO persons (name, age) VALUES ("Lucy BoBucie", 25);
INSERT INTO persons (name, age) VALUES ("Banana FoFanna", 14);
INSERT INTO persons (name, age) VALUES ("Shish Kabob", 20);
INSERT INTO persons (name, age) VALUES ("Fluffy Sparkles", 8);
insert into persons( name, age) values ("Pibe Cantina", 10); 

CREATE table hobbies (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    person_id INTEGER,
    name TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO hobbies (person_id, name) VALUES (1, "drawing");
INSERT INTO hobbies (person_id, name) VALUES (1, "coding");
INSERT INTO hobbies (person_id, name) VALUES (2, "dancing");
INSERT INTO hobbies (person_id, name) VALUES (2, "coding");
INSERT INTO hobbies (person_id, name) VALUES (3, "skating");
INSERT INTO hobbies (person_id, name) VALUES (3, "rowing");
INSERT INTO hobbies (person_id, name) VALUES (3, "drawing");
INSERT INTO hobbies (person_id, name) VALUES (4, "coding");
INSERT INTO hobbies (person_id, name) VALUES (4, "dilly-dallying");
INSERT INTO hobbies (person_id, name) VALUES (4, "meowing");
insert into hobbies (person_id, name) VALUES(5, "running"); 


--2.select the 2 tables with a join so that you can see each person's name next to their hobby.

select persons.name, hobbies.name
from persons
join hobbies
on persons.id= hobbies.person_id;

--3. add an additional query that shows only the name and hobbies of 'Bobby McBobbyFace', using JOIN combined with WHERE.
select persons.name, hobbies.name
from persons
join hobbies
on persons.id= hobbies.person_id
where persons.name ="Bobby McBobbyFace";
