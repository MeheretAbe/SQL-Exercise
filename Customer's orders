--The query is attempting to retrieve information about customers and their corresponding orders using a left outer join between the "customers" and "orders" tables. 

--1. created a database for customers and their orders. Not all of the customers have made orders, however. Come up with a query that lists the name and email of every customer followed by the item and price of orders they've made.
Use a LEFT OUTER JOIN so that a customer is listed even if they've made no orders, and don't add any ORDER BY.

SELECT customers.name, customers.email, orders.item, orders.price
FROM customers
LEFT OUTER JOIN orders
ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;

--2.Create another query that will result in one row per each customer, with their name, email, and total amount of money they've spent on orders. 
Sort the rows according to the total money spent, from the most spent to the least spent.

SELECT  customers.name, customers.email, SUM(orders.price) as "total_price"
FROM customers
LEFT OUTER JOIN orders
ON customers.id = orders.customer_id
GROUP BY customers.name
ORDER BY orders.price DESC;
